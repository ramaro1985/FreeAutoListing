                <h3 style="font-size: 18px">1. The Site is a Venue and We are Not a Party to any Rental Agreement or other Transaction Between Users of the Site.</h3>
                <p>We urge all users to be responsible about their use of this Site and any transaction entered into as a result of either listing a property or renting a property.  We do not own or manage, nor can we contract for, any vacation rental property listed on a Site. HomeEscape.com and other Sites act as a venue to allow homeowners and property managers who advertise on the Site (each, a “member”) to offer for rent in a variety of pricing formats, a specific vacation or short term rental property to potential renters (each, a “traveler” and, collectively with a member, the “users”) for rent (also referred to as users” herein).  "Members" may also include property owners or managers who originally advertised their properties on another website and their listings have been redistributed on the Site. We also may offer online booking or other tools or services to allow users to communicate with each other and enter into rental agreements or other transactions.  </p>
                <p>We are not a party to any rental or other agreement between users.  This is true even if the Site allows you to book a rental or provides other ancillary products or services, as the Site may facilitate booking a rental or other tools, services or products, but we are not a party to any rental or other agreement between users.</p>
                <p>As a result, any part of an actual or potential transaction between a traveler and a member, including the quality, condition, safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings (including the content thereof or any review relating to any property), the ability of members to rent a vacation property or the ability of travelers to contract for properties are solely the responsibility of each user. You acknowledge and agree that you may be required to enter into one or more separate agreements, waivers or terms and conditions prior to making a booking or purchasing a product or service and may place additional restrictions on your booking, product or service.</p>
                <p><b>Responsibility for applicable laws, rules and regulations: </b>Users agree that they are responsible for, and agree to abide by, all laws, rules and regulations applicable to their use of the Site, their use of any tool, service or product offered on the Site and any transaction they enter into on the Site or in connection with their use of the Site.</p>
                <p>Members further agree that they are responsible for and agree to abide by all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the listing of their rental property and the conduct of their rental business, including but not limited to any and all laws, rules, regulations or other requirements relating to taxes, credit cards, data and privacy, taxes, permits or license requirements, zoning ordinances, safety compliance and compliance with all anti-discrimination and fair housing laws, as applicable. Please be aware that, even though we are not a party to any rental transaction and assume no liability for legal or regulatory compliance pertaining to rental properties listed on the Site, there may be circumstances where we are nevertheless legally obligated (as we may determine in our sole discretion) to provide information relating to your listing in order to comply with governmental bodies in relation to investigations, litigation or administrative proceedings, and we may choose to comply with or disregard such obligation in our sole discretion. Members who accept credit card, banking or other payment information from travelers agree to properly handle and safeguard all such information in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and best practices.
                    Travel Advisories:  Although most travel is completed without a serious incident, travel to some destinations may involve more risk than others.  We urge travelers to research the location they wish to visit and to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government prior to booking.

                <p>User verification on the Internet is difficult and we cannot, and do not assume any responsibility for, the confirmation of each user's purported identity. We encourage you to communicate directly with a traveler or member through the tools available on the Site, though even this does not assure you of the identity of the person with which you are communicating. We further encourage you to take other reasonable measures to assure yourself of the other person’s identity and, for travelers, of the property and relevant details of your booking or proposed booking.</p>
                <p>You agree to (i) keep your password and online ID for both your account with us and your email account secure and strictly confidential, providing it only to authorized users of your accounts, (ii) instruct each person to whom you give your online ID and password that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized person, (iii) notify us immediately and select a new online ID and password if you believe your password for either your account with us or your email account may have become known to an unauthorized person, and (iv) notify us immediately if you are contacted by anyone requesting your online ID and password.  Further, if we suspect any unauthorized access to your account, upon our request, you agree to promptly change your ID and password and take any other related action as we may reasonably request.</p>
                <p>We discourage you from giving anyone access to your online ID and password for your account with us and your email account.  However, if you do give someone your online ID and online password, or if you fail to adequately safeguard such information, you are responsible for any and all transactions that the person performs while using your account with us or your email account, even those transactions that are fraudulent or that you did not intend or want performed.</p>
                <p>EACH USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (1) NEITHER HOMEESCAPE NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY USER FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION MADE USING ANY USER’S ID OR PASSWORD; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR ONLINE ID AND PASSWORD FOR YOUR HOMEESCAPE ACCOUNT OR YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO BOTH HOMEESCAPE AND OTHER USERS.  Further, we may, without notice to you, suspend or cancel your listing at any time even without receiving notice from you if we suspect, in our sole discretion, that your account with us or your email account is being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner. </p>

The following are general guidelines:  It is usually permissible for you to refer to HomeEscape or the name of one of our affiliate websites on which you list your property in a descriptive manner in your listing on the Site or in other permissible communications. For example, you might say "Check out my vacation rental on HomeEscape," or "I list properties on HomeEscape."  However, you may not refer to HomeEscape or any of our affiliates in any way that might lead someone to believe that your company or site is sponsored by, affiliated with, or endorsed by HomeEscape or one of our affiliates.  For example, you may not say “HomeEscape sponsors my vacation rental,” or describe your property as “HomeEscape’s best vacation rental.”  You may not use the HomeEscape name or one of our affiliates’ names on any other website that lists vacation rentals without our prior written authorization.</p>

                <p>Each listing must relate to an individual and uniquely identified property, unless (i) you are a property manager who has signed up for one of our packages for members who are property managers or (ii) you otherwise purchased a listing package that expressly allows for substitution of properties. This means that:</p>
                <p>(a)    The property in a listing may not be substituted for another property without our consent.  We may approve a request in our discretion if the property manager's contract for the property was terminated and the member provides sufficient proof, as requested by us, and completes any additional request forms we may request.  The term of the subscription for any substituted property shall be the same as the term of the originally listed property (i.e., the term will not be extended past the original term).</p>
                <p>If a member submits changes to an existing listing that, if approved, would substantially alter the listing to make it that of another property, then we have the right to terminate the listing and may choose, in our sole discretion, to retain any fees associated with the term of the previously existing listing as compensation for the violation of this condition.</p>
                <p>(b)    The listing specifically cannot be a mere example of properties in a given area.  Only one property can appear on each listing, unless it is a property with multiple rental units on the same site.  We reserve the right to amend the copy or remove any listing when more than one property is described in such listing.</p>

                <p>Payments between members and travelers: We are not a party to any payment transaction between members and travelers, even if we receive a commission in connection with any payment transaction.  No member may request any traveler to mail cash, or utilize any instant-cash wire transfer service such as Western Union or MoneyGram in payment for all or part of a property rental transaction. Any violation of this term or any other unacceptable payment methods that may be posted on the Site may result in the immediate removal of the non-conforming listing from the Site without notice to the member.  From time to time, we may become aware of users attempting to conduct a transaction that would involve an unauthorized payment method or a fraudulent payment method.  Ideally, we hope to be able to assist users in avoiding such transactions, but we assume no liability or responsibility to do so or to inform users of any such actual or suspected activity.</p>
                <p><b>Our Right to Terminate a Listing: </b>If, in our sole discretion, any member submits unsuitable material to our Site or into our database, misuses the Site or our online system or is in material breach of these Terms, we reserve the right to terminate such member’s subscription(s) immediately without refund. In addition, if we become aware of or receive a complaint or a series of complaints from any user or other third party regarding a member’s listing or rental practices that, in our sole discretion, warrants the immediate removal of such member’s listing from the Site (for example, and without limitation, if a member double-books a property for multiple travelers on the same date, or engages in any practice that, in our sole discretion, would be considered deceptive, unfair or improper within the vacation rental industry or in an online marketplace for vacation rentals, if we determine or suspect that the member’s payment-related practices or procedures are not secure, legal or otherwise proper, or if we receive a complaint that any listing’s content infringes on the rights of a third party), then we may immediately terminate such member’s listing(s) or subscription(s) without notice to the member and without refund.  We assume no duty to investigate complaints.  Finally, if any member is abusive or offensive to any employee or representative of the HomeEscape Group, we reserve the right to terminate such member’s listing(s) or subscription(s) immediately without refund. Finally, if any member is in breach of these Terms or its obligations to us or any of our third party providers then we may terminate such member’s subscription(s) immediately without notice to the member and without refund.</p>
                <p><b>Transfer of Listing to a Third Party: </b>No listing may be transferred to another party. In the event of a property sale or change in property management, HomeEscape will provide guidance on options for creating a new listing.</p>
